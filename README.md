# MLOps Training

**Goal**:
As the importance of machine learning grows over time, it is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to create a reliable Machine Learning model and make it to production. Here comes the role of MLOps,it's a set of tools and practices with the aim to achieve faster experimentation, faster deployment and quality assurance of our Machine Learning systems. During these training we will discover the different concepts of MLOps and how we can implement them in real world projects. 

Example of the workflow we'll be developing during this training.
